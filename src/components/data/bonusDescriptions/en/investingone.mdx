### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to redeem your stocks:

1. Create an account on Investing.one.
2. Upload your ID card or passport to verify your profile. Sometimes proof of residence is also required; you can use a bank statement from any bank for this.
3. Once verified, deposit €10 (I recommend €11 to be safe) via card, Google Pay, or bank transfer.
4. Make any investment (you can sell the purchased stock and withdraw the deposit immediately).
5. **Claim the reward:** Open the app and click on **"Claim Reward"** within 14 days of receiving the notification. You will be asked to choose 3 stocks in which to receive the reward.

⚠️ The reward will be shown immediately in your account but will be locked for 90 days. **The deposit, however, can be withdrawn immediately**.
Even if not withdrawable for 90 days, you can still sell and buy stocks using the bonus balance. If the stocks increase in value, sell them and obtain a profit; that profit is withdrawable even during the lock-up period.

**Warning on Inactivity:** To prevent your account from being considered inactive and the bonus from being revoked, I recommend keeping it slightly active. It is sufficient to perform **6 transactions** (buy or sell, including with the bonus balance) and at least **2 deposits** (the one already made for the bonus requirements also counts, so just 1 additional deposit of any amount is enough) within the first 90 days of claiming the reward.
