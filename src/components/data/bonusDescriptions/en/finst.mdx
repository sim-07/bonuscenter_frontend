### Main Requirements

To correctly participate in the promotion and receive the €50 reward, make sure to meet these criteria by **28/02/2026**:

* **Minimum Deposit:** You must deposit at least **€500** into your Finst account (To avoid issues due to fees, I recommend depositing slightly more, such as €515. These funds are withdrawable immediately).
* **Trading Volume:** You must execute buy or sell trades for a total of at least **€5,000**.
  * *Example:* With a €500 deposit, 10 trades (e.g., 5 buys and 5 sells) are sufficient to reach the required volume.
* **Identity Verification:** You must complete the identification process (KYC) with an ID document and biometric recognition.
* **Reward Limit:** You can receive a maximum of **5 bonuses per promotional period** (maximum €250 total from referrals).

3. **Deposit:** Make a bank transfer of at least **€500** to your new Finst account (use your personal IBAN provided by the app).
4. **Trading:** Use the funds to trade cryptocurrencies (e.g., EUR/BTC) until you generate a total volume of **€5,000**. *5 buys and 5 sells are enough*.
5. **Receive Bonus:** If you complete everything by 28/02, you will receive the **€50 in Bitcoin at the beginning of March**.
