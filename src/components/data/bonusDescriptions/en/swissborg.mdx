### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to ensure you don't miss out on the bonus:

1. Download the app via a friend's **referral link**. During registration, ensure the promo code is present. You can manually enter the referral code within 7 days of registration if you didn't sign up via a link.
2. Complete the registration process and upload the required documents. Identity verification usually takes only a few minutes.
3. Make a deposit of at least **€100**. You can do this via bank transfer (free) or by transferring crypto from an external wallet.
4. Once the funds are credited, exchange them for another asset (e.g., convert your €100 into USDC or Bitcoin). This action officially unlocks the reward.
5. **Redeem your reward:** You will receive a notification. Go to the **"Referral"** section (under your profile) and choose how to receive your bonus:
    * **Fixed Reward:** For those who prefer a guaranteed amount without surprises, though it is usually a smaller sum.
    * **Scratch Card:** For those who want to try their luck and aim for the maximum prize of **€50 in BTC**.
