## What is Revolut and how the bonus works

**Revolut** is a global financial app that allows you to manage money, spend abroad, and exchange currency. The "Refer a Friend" campaign is an initiative that allows existing users to earn a reward by inviting their contacts to sign up.

The promotion operates under specific rules:
* **Who receives the bonus:** Only the person who invites (the referrer) is eligible for the reward.
* **Limits:** You can earn rewards for a maximum of **5 referrals** per campaign.

All progress is trackable directly within the app: once the invitee completes a step, it is marked in green in the "Refer Friends" section.

### Step-by-step guide to unlock the bonus

For the referrer to receive the reward, the invited friend must strictly follow a series of steps. Here is what the invitee needs to do:

* **Sign up via Unique Link:** They must sign up as a *new customer* (must have never had a Revolut account before) using only the referral link sent to them. They must also complete the identity verification process. *Note: Revolut \<18 accounts are not eligible.*
* **Add Funds:** The account must be topped up via card (debit/credit), Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfer.
    * *Attention:* Internal money transfers between Revolut accounts are not valid.
* **Order a Card:** The invitee must order a **physical card**.
    * *Exclusions:* Cards associated with Revolut Pro, Revolut Business, Joint accounts, or Revolut \<18 do not count towards the offer.
* **Make Purchases:** The invitee must complete a minimum number of legitimate purchases (online or in-store).
    * Purchases made with a physical card, virtual card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay are all valid.
    * The amount of each purchase must be equal to or greater than the minimum amount visible in the Referrals screen.

Not all expenses are valid for reaching the goal. The following are expressly **excluded**: currency exchange operations, sending money, gambling-related transactions, and gift card purchases.

💡 **Important Detail:** Card payment transactions will be marked as completed (green checkmark in the app) only when they are **fully processed** by the banking system, not at the exact moment of the transaction. Make sure the invitee completes their spending a few days before the deadline to avoid delays in processing.
