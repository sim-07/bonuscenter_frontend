## What is Octopus Energy and how the bonus works

**Octopus Energy** is an electricity and gas supplier. The **#OCTOFRIENDS** initiative rewards customers who invite their friends, incentivizing word-of-mouth through a bill credit of **€30**.
You can find all information about Octopus Energy at https://octopusenergy.it/
The promotion works simply:
* The standard bonus offers **€30** (VAT included) for both the inviting Customer and the invited Friend.
* For every new supply successfully activated, the credit is applied to the first available bill following the credit issuance.
* **Special Promotion:** Exclusively for activations between **14/10/2025 and 30/10/2025**, the bonus for both increases to **€50**.

By inviting people to join Octopus Energy, you could completely zero out your future bills!
In fact, you will accumulate €30 for every friend who becomes an Octopus Energy customer. The discounts are cumulative with other bonuses or promotions, and will be deducted from the first available bill or subsequent ones until exhausted.


### The guide to unlocking the bonus

If you are the friend being invited, make sure you have everything you need on hand before clicking the link. To activate the contract with Octopus Energy, you will need:

* **An old bill:** You will need this to retrieve the **POD** code (for electricity) or **PDR** code (for gas).
* **Identity document:** Valid.
* **IBAN code:** For automatic bill payment (Direct Debit).
* **Personal details:** Tax code (Codice Fiscale) and an active email address.

It is crucial that the friend has not been an Octopus customer in the past and completes the procedure exclusively via the received link; otherwise, the system will not be able to associate the invite with your account.

The final and most important step is **activation**. The bonus does not appear immediately after registration is finished, but at the moment the supply becomes technically active (i.e., when Octopus officially becomes the new supplier, usually the first day of the month following acceptance). At that moment, the €30 credit will be loaded onto both accounts and automatically deducted from the first available bill.

💡 **A tip:** If the amount of your first bill is lower than the €30 bonus, don't worry: you won't lose a cent. The remaining credit will be applied to the next month's bill until exhausted.
